# goth-deploy

A lightweight deployment platform for server-rendered web apps built with the **GoTH stack**:  
**Go 1.23 + HTMX + TailwindCSS + [templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ)**

## ⚡ What is it?

`goth-deploy` lets you connect a GitHub repository and deploy your GoTH app to a custom subdomain in seconds — like `myapp.gothub.sh`.  
No YAML, no JS frameworks, no containers — just idiomatic Go and hypermedia.

## ✨ Features

- 🌀 HTMX-native routing & interactivity (zero custom JS)
- 🎨 Templ-based server rendering
- 🌐 Auto subdomain provisioning per deployment
- 🧰 Minimal config (convention over configuration)
- 🔒 Secure and idiomatic Go 1.23 backend
- ⚙️ GitHub OAuth + Webhook support for continuous deployment

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **Set up GitHub OAuth credentials**
3. **Run the server locally**
4. **Push a GoTH app and deploy it**
